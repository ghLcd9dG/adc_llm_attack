# Efficient LLM Jailbreak via Adaptive Dense-to-sparse Constrained Optimization

This is a draft implementation of our paper

- [NeurIPS 2024] [Efficient LLM Jailbreak via Adaptive Dense-to-sparse Constrained Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09113)
  
An official implementation will be ready soon.

TODO:
As mentioned in https://github.com/hukkai/adc_llm_attack/issues/2, the code is outdated with the latest version of `transformers`, but runable at `transformers==4.39`.


Add a TODO for either specifying the version  requirements or refactor the code for a newer version of `transformers`.
